Personal homepage

This is a personal homepage I designed for one of my Harvard CS50 projects. 

I was definitely most excited about figuring out how to include a csv file with all the books I've recently read that will automatically updated on the website.

If anyone has any advice or feedback, I'm open to hearing it!
